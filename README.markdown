# RailsCollab
## What is it?

RailsCollab is a free web based Project Management and Collaboration tool largely inspired by [Basecamp] [1], 
the communication-oriented project management solution from 37signals. 

Its roots come from a similar project called ProjectPier (previously known as ActiveCollab), 
which instead of Ruby is written in PHP.

## Manage projects. How?

In RailsCollab, you have the following:

* *Task lists* - to keep track of what needs to get done, and who is responsible
* *Milestones* - to track what needs to get done and by whom
* *Times* - to record how much time has been spent on a project or task
* *Files* - to share data with your clients
* *Messages* - for centralized communication

You can add clients to your projects at any time. Each member of a client can have a login, 
whose access can be restricted to certain elements of the project.
